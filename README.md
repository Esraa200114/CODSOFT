## Flashlight App ðŸ”¦
### An app that turns on the device's flashlight when the app is launched and turns it off when the app is closed.

## Covered Rules
### 1. UI Design: The layout contains a single screen with a toggle button (`flashlightSwitch`) to control the flashlight. The `Switch` is provided for the user to turn the flashlight on and off.

### 2. Flashlight Functionality: The code checks for the availability of a camera flash on the device using `getPackageManager().hasSystemFeature(PackageManager.FEATURE_CAMERA_FLASH)`. If the device has a camera flash, it will use the `CameraManager` to turn on and off the flashlight based on the user's input (`isChecked` parameter).

### 3. App Lifecycle: The app handles the lifecycle events by overriding the `onPause()` and `onDestroy()` methods. When the app is paused or destroyed, the flashlight is turned off using `flashLight(false)` to ensure the flashlight is not left on when the app is closed.

### 4. Error Handling: The code implements error handling for scenarios where the device doesn't have a camera flash or if the flashlight fails to turn on. If the device doesn't have a camera flash, it displays a toast message: "No flashlight available on your device." If there's any `CameraAccessException` during the flashlight operation, it prints the stack trace to handle the exception.

## Calculator App ðŸ–©
### An app that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Covered Rules
### 1. UI Design: The layout includes an equal button (=), a clear button, a clear-all button (AC), a dot character button (.), number buttons (0â€“9), and operator buttons (+, -, x, /), along with a display area to show the entered numbers, the operation being performed, and the results. 

### 2. Number Input: The `onNumberClickEvent` method captures user input when number buttons are pressed and stores the entered numbers for further processing. 

### 3. Operator Selection: The `onOperatorClickEvent` method enables the selection of arithmetic operators through button clicks and identifies the selected operator. 

### 4. Calculation: The `onEqualClickEvent` method performs arithmetic calculations based on the selected operator and handles division by zero and invalid operations. 

### 5. Display: The display area is updated in various parts of the code to show entered numbers, operators, and results. Decimal numbers are handled using the dot character button, and the rounding is performed using the `RoundingMode.HALF_UP mode`. In this project, I specified the number of decimal places to be 5. 

### 6. Clear and Reset: The `onAllClearClickEvent` method adds an all-clear button to reset the calculator, clearing entered numbers and resetting other variables. While the `onClearClickEvent` method is used to remove the last entered digit or dot character. 

### 7. Error Handling: The code includes various checks for error handling. For example, it shows appropriate messages for invalid input and operations and handles the display of errors in the result area.

### ~ Invalid Operations and input such as:
#### 1. Division by zero.
#### 2. Having more than one decimal point in a number.
#### 3. Entering consecutive decimal points.
#### 4. Exceeding the character limit.
#### 5. Entering consecutive arithmetic operators.
#### 6. Starting with an operator without providing the first operand.
#### 7. Pressing the equal button without entering operands first.

### 8. Handling Overflow: By checking if a BigDecimal variable called `output_big_decimal` exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by a double data type in Java. If it does, it is considered an overflow, and a flag is set to `true` to indicate the overflow. The text color of the result field is changed to red and a text saying "Overflow occurred" is displayed in it. Otherwise, if no overflow is detected, the output is formatted using the "FormatBigDecimal" function, and the BigDecimal value is displayed in the result field.

## Window Notification App ðŸ””
### A simple notification window app using Android's Notification system. The app consists of one activity with two buttons, each triggering different types of notifications when clicked. 

### ~ Random Fact Notifications: When the first button is clicked, the app generates a notification with a random title and body containing a fact. Each time the button is clicked, a new notification is displayed, providing users with interesting facts.

### ~ Hydration Reminder Notifications: The second button, when clicked, triggers a notification reminding users to stay hydrated. Similar to the random fact notifications, this notification also features a randomly generated title and body to keep the content fresh and engaging.

## Covered Rules:
### 1. Importing Necessary Libraries for GUI Development: I've made sure to import the essential Android libraries needed for creating a graphical user interface, including `android.app.*`, `android.content.*`, `android.widget.*`, and more.

### 2. Designing the Notification Window with Title, Message, and Image/Icon: I've designed a notification layout using the `RemoteViews` approach within my `getNotificationChannel` method. This design includes setting up the title, message, and icon for the notification.

### 3. Creating and Displaying the Notification Window: I've successfully implemented the logic that allows me to create and display notifications using the `NotificationCompat.Builder` and `NotificationManagerCompat` classes.

### 4. Setting the Notification Title, Message, and Image/Icon: Within the `getNotificationChannel` method, I ensure to set the notification's title, message, and image/icon using the `RemoteViews` customization.

### 5. Enabling User Interaction with the Notification: I've taken care to include interactive features in the notifications. Specifically, I've added action buttons like "View" and "Dismiss," which empower users to engage with the notifications based on their preferences.

### 6. Customizing the Notification's Appearance: To provide a personalized touch, I've meticulously customized the appearance of notification channels using the `createNotificationChannels` method. Additionally, I've fine-tuned individual notifications by specifying color, priority, and style within the `getNotificationChannel` method.

### 7. Handling Errors or Exceptions: I've been proactive in dealing with potential errors or exceptions that might arise during notification creation. I've incorporated `try-catch` blocks to ensure that any issues are managed gracefully.

### 8. Ensuring Compatibility Through Testing: While I haven't explicitly demonstrated it, I've adhered to Android's recommended guidelines, which should ensure that my code works across various Android versions. It's crucial to test the application on diverse devices and Android iterations to guarantee compatibility and a smooth user experience.
